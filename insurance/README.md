# PyCaret Insurance Regression

This repository contains code for performing regression analysis on the insurance dataset using the PyCaret library. PyCaret is an open-source machine learning library that makes it easy to build, compare, and tune machine learning models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- PyCaret (2.3.0 or higher)
- matplotlib (optional - only required for visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/insurance_regression.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd insurance_regression
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the 'insurance' dataset, which contains information about individuals and their health insurance charges.

### Code Overview

The main code is provided in the `insurance_regression.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It contains the following sections:

1. Importing Libraries and Loading the Dataset: This section imports the necessary libraries and loads the 'insurance' dataset using PyCaret's `get_data` function.

2. Data Preprocessing and Setup: The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical variables to numeric representations. PyCaret's `setup` function is then used to set up the data for regression modeling.

3. Model Comparison: The `compare_models` function is used to compare the performance of various regression models available in PyCaret.

4. Building a Gradient Boosting Regressor: The Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model is selected based on the comparison and created using the `create_model` function.

5. Saving and Loading the Model: The trained GBR model is saved to disk using `save_model`, and then it is loaded back using `load_model`.

6. Making Predictions: A sample input data is created, and the loaded model is used to make predictions on this data using the `predict_model` function.

### How to Use

1. Open the `insurance_regression.ipynb` notebook.

2. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model setup, comparison, training, and prediction.

### Additional Notes

- The project uses the PyCaret library, which simplifies the machine learning workflow. For more details on PyCaret, visit the official documentation: [PyCaret Documentation](https://pycaret.org).

- The dataset used in this project is a sample dataset provided by PyCaret.

- You can experiment with different models, hyperparameters, and datasets to customize the analysis as per your requirements.
